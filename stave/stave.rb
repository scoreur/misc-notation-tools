module Stave
  #This library should be using some image libraries written

  #The image library should provide an interface and hide out 
  #stupid details. 
  #In other words, model, view, controller should be separated. 

  #I'm gonna store the drawing commands in some data structure, 
  #presumably a list. After I stored it, let the client program
  #to parse it for itself, see staveview.h

  #This module primarily concerns with the rendering of stave. 
  #Inputting DSL can be implemented in another module.

  class Position
    #Each music object occupies some place, which should be 
    #characterized by this class. A position has two representations: 
    #the first (high level) as the x-coordinate on the stave if the 
    #stave is rendered on an infinitely wide page, and line number
    #on which it occupies. *** I'll call it a, b. ***
    #the second (low level) as x and y on the image.

    #pa is parent's a

    #When we specify a position in MusicObject, we specify the high
    #level version. The conversion between high and low position
    #should be implemented in the class, which enables us to create
    #low-level drawing commands to the C++ drawing program. 

    #Position can be chained: intuitively you have a position object 
    #points at 211B. The position object should be able to create 
    #a Position instance that enable you to describe relative position
    #to it, which in turn still has such capability (see def around).
